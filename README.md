# Ursina Block Builder

A simple Minecraft-like block sandbox game built with **Python** and the **Ursina Engine**.

This project is published as a **learning and portfolio project** to demonstrate my understanding of:
- Python programming
- Object-oriented design
- Code organization
- Basic game logic
- Git & GitHub workflow

---

## Features

- First-person movement (WASD + mouse)
- Place and break blocks
- Block selection using hotbar (1–9 + mouse scroll)
- Pause menu (ESC)
- Save and load world using JSON
- Modular and clean Python code structure

---

## Controls

- Move: W A S D  
- Look: Mouse  
- Jump: Space

## Assets

Game assets (textures and sounds) are **not included** in this repository.

The purpose of this project is to focus on **Python code structure and logic**, not on asset creation.
Any free voxel-style textures and sounds can be used to run the project.

## Credits & Inspiration

Inspired by early Minecraft-style prototypes, including:
https://github.com/beaucarnes/zizyo

The codebase, structure, and features were significantly rewritten and extended.
